1.For the largest input file(movies.txt), I use around 30 secondes to build a Tire. For searching the words, the algorithm only use time less than a second. 

2. Based on the graph, I think the complexity of my algorithm to build the Trie is roughly O(n). However, there are some weird peaks.

3.Building the Tire spent too much time, especially in building each nodes. For movie dataset, building all nodes spends 13.889 seconds. Since I use dictionary to store the information, I might think it is the best structure to do this.
